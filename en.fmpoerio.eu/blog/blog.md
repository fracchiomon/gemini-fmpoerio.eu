Here we are, in the Blog homepage, where you'll find all its posts. What am I going to talk about?  
Well, a bit of everything: from music to movies, depression and mental illness, disadventures, university, politics and society, etc...  
Always with the will of being as open-minded as I can.  
So, we will talk about all kind of things, always badly.  
Good reading. â™¡
